# Geo mapping schools

This is a simple tool that takes a list of coordinates and groups them into sets of locations that sales reps can visit in single day trips.

# Tools

This was built using the following tools, which sort of explains why it's such a mess:
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
- [Isomorphic react generator](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit)
- [React google maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps)
